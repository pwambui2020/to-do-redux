# This is a To Do App

On this project I'm working on a todo app using Redux

You can ADD, REMOVE, UPDATE and COMPLETE tasks. 

I'm using REDUCERS that update the states when an action is dispatched.

I have components to manage and display the to do list

I have used react-icons for the cards with the individual task
